Can you help me to load the data I uploaded? My file is tmp/domain1.txt
Can you help me to check whether ambiguity exists in my data?
Can you help me to visualize the ambiguous groups?
Please help me to generate all self-ambiguity mapping matrices.

Can you help me to load the data I uploaded? My file is tmp/label_domain1.txt
Could you please help me to visualize the data domain based on its label?

Can you help me to load the data I uploaded? My file is tmp/domain2.txt
Can you help me to load the data I uploaded? My file is tmp/label_domain2.txt
Please help me to align the two data domains using SCOT.



Can you help me to visualize two domains aligned by SCOT with labels?

Can you help me to generate alternative mapping matrices for SCOT based on SONATA self-ambiguity mapping matrices.
Can you help me to visualize alternative mapping matrices for SCOT generated by SONATA based on labels?



print(""" You can ask me questions like this!
If you want to use SONATA to check whether ambiguity exist in your data, you can ask:
1. Can you help me load the data I uploaded? My file is tmp/domain1.txt
2. Can you help me to check whether ambiguity exists in my data?
3. Can you help me to visualize the ambiguous groups?
4. Please help me to generate all self-ambiguity mapping matrices.

If you want to visualize your input data, you can ask:
1. Can you help me to load the data I uploaded? My file is tmp/label_domain1.txt
2. Could you please help me to visualize the data domain based on its label?


Then if you want to use SONATA to generate alternative solutions for a manifold aligner, firstly you can ask:
1. Can you help me to load the data I uploaded? My file is tmp/domain2.txt
2. Please help me to align the two data domains using SCOT.

Then you can visualize the visualization result by asking:
1. Can you help me to load the data I uploaded? My file is tmp/label_domain2.txt
2. Can you help me to visualize two domains aligned by SCOT with labels?

Finally, you can ask SONATA to generate/visualize alternative solutions by:
1. Can you help me to generate alternative mapping matrices for SCOT based on SONATA self-ambiguity mapping matrices.
2. Can you help me to visualize alternative mapping matrices for SCOT generated by SONATA based on labels?""")
